1. Keyword Matching with Intent Recognition:

Approach: Develop a system that matches keywords in the question to keywords associated with your existing answers. Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to improve accuracy. Additionally, identify the intent behind the question (e.g., size, material, care instructions) using techniques like named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. This helps select the most relevant answer even if the exact keywords don't match.
2. Chatbot with Rule-based Responses:

Approach: Create a chatbot with pre-defined rules based on keywords and intents. Users input their question, the chatbot identifies keywords and intent, and triggers the associated pre-written answer. This is efficient for frequently asked questions but lacks flexibility for less common inquiries.
3. Hybrid Approach:

Approach: Combine keyword matching with a pre-trained language model like BERT or LaMDA. This allows for more nuanced understanding of questions and better selection of relevant answers. You can still have pre-written responses for common questions, but the language model can handle variations and less frequent inquiries.
4. Active Learning and User Feedback:

Approach: Start with a smaller set of labeled data and use it to train a learning model. Continuously improve the model by incorporating user feedback and manually labeling new questions that it struggles with. This can be time-consuming initially but helps build a more robust system in the long run.
5. Consider Third-party Solutions:

Approach: Explore pre-built solutions for e-commerce Q&A like Zendesk Answer Bot or Askava. These offer ready-made functionality and can be tailored to your specific needs.
Additional Tips:

Focus on quality: Ensure your answers are accurate, informative, and well-written. Poorly formatted or irrelevant answers can hurt user experience.
Organize your answers: Categorize answers by product, topic, or question type. This makes it easier for users to find what they need.
Monitor and update: Regularly review your Q&A section and update answers as needed based on new information or user feedback.
Remember, the best approach depends on your specific resources, data volume, and desired level of customization. Evaluate each option based on your needs and choose the one that offers the best balance of efficiency and accuracy.
