It sounds like you're planning to enhance your question-answering system by incorporating NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) to generate answers based on keywords extracted from questions. Then, you'll compare these manually generated answers with those generated by Language Models (LLMs) and select the one that matches more closely.

Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow:

Input Question and Answer Pairs: Provide both questions and answers to your system.

Generate Manual Answers: Extract keywords from questions using NLP techniques like NER. Based on these keywords, manually generate answers that are relevant to the questions.

Generate Answers with Language Models (LLMs): Use LLMs to generate answers based on the provided questions.

Compare Answers: Compare the answers generated by NLP techniques with those generated by LLMs. You can use similarity metrics or techniques like cosine similarity to measure the similarity between the answers.

Select Final Answer: Choose the answer that has the highest similarity with the manually generated answer or use a threshold to determine when a generated answer is sufficiently close to the manual one.

Output Final Answer: Present the selected answer as the final output of your question-answering system.

Remember to fine-tune and adjust your approach based on the specific requirements and nuances of your application. Additionally, consider evaluating the performance of your system using a validation set to ensure its effectiveness in providing accurate answers.
